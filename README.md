### Prerequisites
- List of libraries required:
    - pandas as pd
    - numpy as np
    - matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    - seaborn as sns
    - plotly.express as px
    - import re

### Steps
1. The data is very large and can be downloaded from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running
2. Gather further information in regards to the data referenced you want to learn about.  I chose the top 100 races by distance (Not by time i.e. a 24 hour run) and only in the United States.  I then added elevation gain as well as the highest elevation point of each race.  I also included the state each event was located in.  For this I just used open source search engines.  I have added my newfound data to the data files.
3. Merge the data to clean.

## Usage
-(add examples of the data being used for midterm purposes)
